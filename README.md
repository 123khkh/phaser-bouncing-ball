## GitHub Copilot

When you have things set up, it's time to install **GitHub Copilot** and **GitHub Copilot Chat** to get some AI asssitance.

1. Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
2. In the search bar at the top, type `GitHub Copilot` and press Enter.
3. Find the extension named **GitHub Copilot** (listed as by GitHub) and click the `Install` button.
4. Next, clear the search bar and type `GitHub Copilot Chat`, and `Install` it.
5. After both installations, you can access Copilot by clicking on the GitHub Copilot icon (which looks like an oval with two eyes and goggles) on the right of the command palette.

You're all set to use `GitHub Copilot` and `GitHub Copilot Chat` in your projects! Do note that GitHub Copilot Chat's free tier only supports 50 messages a month -- use carefully and sparingly!
